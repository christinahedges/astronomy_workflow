    "\n",
    "*TL;DR: Making documentation for your package is vital, using mkdocs makes that step much easier.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Making documentation is **vital** to the success of your package. If you do not add documentation, not only will no one else understand what you have done, you will not understand what you've done in two years time. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few tools to help you make websites/documentation for your tools. Personally, I find `mkdocs` makes pretty documentation, and has the easiest to remember commands. For me, it's the easiest tool. However, you might prefer other tools, like `sphinx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do I have to?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What counts as documentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation could be inline comments in your code to explain what you're doing and why. Documentation is also docstrings in your functions and classes. These are helpful (read: crucial) for users to understand how to interact with your functions and classes. Documentation is also README files, webpages, and tutorials. You should do at least some of these!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I do it with minimal effort?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where `mkdocs` comes in! `mkdocs` will turn your docstrings into a nice website for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I would go about making documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Add docstrings to all your functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I make a new function, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_ten(x):\n",
    "    return x + 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I now need to document the function. I like the `numpy` docstring style, so I would document like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_ten(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Function to add 10 to an input\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameters\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    x : int, float\n",
    "        Input value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    result : int, float\n",
    "        x + 10\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return x + 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is overkill for a small function, but the key parts are 1. a short description (which can go into a longer description if needed) 2. A list of the parameters 3. A list of the objects that get returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Install and start a `mkdocs` project\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, to install mkdocs you will need to install the following (here I'm using `poetry`!)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry add -D mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocstrings\n",
    "poetry add -D pytkdocs -E numpy-style\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install `mkdocs`, the `mkdocs-material` style, and will let you parse docstrings in the `numpy` style used above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `mkdocs` you will need to first make a project using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry run mkdocs new .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a `docs` directory, and a `mkdocs.yml` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Alter the mkdocs.yml and markdown files. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the `mkdocs.yml` file is where you're going to specify some key parts about your docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "site_name: my_package\n",
    "nav:\n",
    "    - Home: index.md\n",
    "    - API: api.md\n",
    "\n",
    "theme:\n",
    "  name: \"material\"\n",
    "repo_url: https://github.com/SSDataLab/my_package\n",
    "plugins:\n",
    "  - search\n",
    "  - mkdocstrings:\n",
    "      default_handler: python\n",
    "      handlers:\n",
    "        python:\n",
    "          selection:\n",
    "            docstring_style: \"numpy\"\n",
    "          rendering:\n",
    "            show_source: false\n",
    "      custom_templates: templates\n",
    "      watch:\n",
    "        - src/my_package\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're telling `mkdocs` that we want a single homepage, we want to use the \"material\" theme, and we want to automatically build the documentation for the docstrings using the numpy style.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next piece we need is `index.md`. You will find this file in your `docs/` directory. This is a simple markdown file, which you can change to add some simple docs. You can make this a copy of your README file if you like, or you can add some extra detail on your package like install instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you'll need something like a markdown file for your package docs. Here `docs/api.md` may look like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Documentation for `BackDrop`\n",
    "\n",
    "::: tess_backdrop.BackDrop\n",
    "    handler: python\n",
    "    selection:\n",
    "      members:\n",
    "        - BackDrop\n",
    "        - load\n",
    "        - build_correction\n",
    "        - fit_model\n",
    "        - save\n",
    "    rendering:\n",
    "      show_root_heading: false\n",
    "      show_source: false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have a class called `BackDrop` in my package `tess_backdrop`. I tell `mkdocs` this is a Python tool, and then ask for it to document the class `BackDrop`, and the methods `load`, `build_correction`, `fit_model` and `save`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Build your doc pages!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fun part. Now you've made these files you can see what your docs will look like. You can use\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry run mkdocs serve\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a local version of your docs page. Navigate your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the docs. This is \"live\", if you change the markdown files you've built, it will automatically update this website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're happy with your docs, you can \"deploy\" them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry run mkdocs gh-deploy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will build your docs, and push them to your gh-pages branch on your GitHub repo. This is a special branch, which is used to create your docs. (Note: you may need to check a box in the settings of your repo for it to use gh-pages automatically https://github.com/SSDataLab/my_package/settings/pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to navigate to \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "username.github.io/my_package\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And see your docs live! For example, check out https://ssdatalab.github.io/tess-backdrop, which has automatic API documentation using this workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "![mkdocs all the way down](figures/mkdocs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are other plugins for mkdocs!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can get a plugin which will run and render jupyter notebooks in your docs!"
