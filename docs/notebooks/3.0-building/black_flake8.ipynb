    "\n",
    "*TL;DR: `black` and `flake8` will make your code pretty and readable, automatically.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### `flake8`\n",
    "[This](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) tool will enforce a style guide for you. `flake8` will throw an error if you run it on a script that doesn't obey your chosen style. You can set up a `.flake8` file which specifies the style you want to keep to. This will let you choose, for example, the max line length you would like. `flake8` will check through your code and look for errors, like importing a package that you don't use.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set up a GitHub action so that flake8 will automatically check the style of any pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `black` \n",
    "[This](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable) tool will automatically format your Python code, in a very sane way. It will automatically check for the right spaces between variables, push long lines into multiple lines, and will raise an error if you have a missing bracket somewhere. I highly recommend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use an editor like [atom](https://atom.io/) for coding (which I also recommend) you can add an extension to have `black` automatically run whenever you save. \n"
