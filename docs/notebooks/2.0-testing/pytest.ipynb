    "## What are unit tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests are small, simple functions which test (ideally) a single part of your tool. Tests check that all parts of your code work correctly (\"pass\") and can be run on different machines and architectures so you know your users won't have issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do I have to make tests\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to, but it will make your package much more usable, and much easier to maintain and fix. It is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How should I make tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really up to you, but there a few sorts of approaches;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build the code, and then test it. This lets you be flexible when designing, but can be a headache to actually test in the end.\n",
    "2. Build the tests, and then write the code. This is known as test driven development, and can be very powerful. You start with tests that should pass, and write code to make sure they do. \n",
    "3. Test as you go. This is a pretty good approach, as you're writing functions and tools, make sure you're adding tests for each new piece of functionality. This means that as you develop, you'll know whether your new functionality breaks your established functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you have a bug in your code, or something is not behaving in the way that you expected, starting by writing a test that should pass can be a great way to fix that problem and ensure that it doesn't happen again. \n",
    "\n",
    "## But really how should I write a test?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do some demos below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tests and merging pull requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you or one or your users will open a pull request against your tool, or will try to add functionality. Having tests is an excellent way to ensure that features being added by new users do not break your original tool. It's good practice to make sure that any pull request that is opened against your tool includes testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directory structures\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to structure your directories but this is the one I like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my-package/\n",
    "... src/\n",
    "....... my-package/\n",
    "........... __init__.py\n",

    "....... data/\n",
    "........... test_data.fits\n",
    "          \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some tools (e.g. [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)) which can test the \"coverage\" of your tests, i.e. how many lines of your code are being called by your tests. Having high coverage means less room for error. \n",
