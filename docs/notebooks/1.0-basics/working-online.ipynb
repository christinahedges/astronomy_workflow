    "# Working together online on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to develop code online with other collaborators. In this case, GitHub is a really great tool. Let's go through a workflow here\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a piece of code you're working on and you have made changes. You're happy with your changes so you use the following to add the changes, commit them, and push them to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m 'My new commit'\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## git clone\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm also working on the same tool, I might want to get your work. I can do this using the `git` command on my terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_tool.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new directory with all your work in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## git pull\n",

    "After a few days, you might have put some more commits in your online repo, and I'm going to want to get them too. So I will get those changes with \n",

    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If I try to push to a repo (assuming I have permission to do so), sometimes there will be a conflict, and I'll need to pull changes down first before it will let me push my own changes with `git push`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Pull request\" here means \"I am a developer, and I request you pull my changes into your code\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working together, pull requests on GitHub are great. They are a way for a user to suggest changes to your code. I open PRs against my own code, because they're a great way to document major changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a repo, and I want to suggest some changes to it, I might follow this workflow. If I have permission to work with your repository on GitHub (because you've given me permission, or because I'm part of the organization that made the repository) I could do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_tool.git\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will make a new branch called `my-new-branch` on GitHub. From there I can open a pull request. GitHub will even prompt you with a `Compare and Pull Request` button. Below is an example of what a pull request looks like.\n",

    "The example here is a tool that I've written, that a collaborator would like to open a pull request against. They've made changes on a branch named `tiled-query` and opened a PR.\n",
    "Here are some of the key things to note\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a space for discussion. We can talk about the good and bad points of the PR, and discuss changes.\n",
    "2. You can see the commit history, and the files that have changed in the PR\n",
    "3. If you have GitHub actions with tests enabled, those will run and check the PR (see a later section for more on that)\n",
    "4. You can request reviews (top right) assign people who should be looking at the PR, and label the PR with handy tags like \"easy\" or \"bug\". \n",
    "\n",
    "When someone opens a PR on one of my repos, I will usually review it, and check that I agree with the changes they are proposing. We'll discuss on the PR, and come to an agreement. Then, if we think it needs to be included in the `main` branch, we will `merge` the pull request. This will put all the changes into the `main` branch. You should only do this when all your tests are passing and you are happy, but in theory it is possible to undo this action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pushing to `main`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes our packages break. Maybe one of our dependencies is broken, or maybe someone has merged a pull request that shouldn't be merged. If I'm a core developer of a package, and if there's a sudden issue, sometimes I might make changes to the code, and instead of going the careful route of opening a PR and having the team review it, I will push directly to the `main` branch. This is living a little dangerously, as pushing straight to `main` without a review could cause an error. Use this with caution, it's better to open PRs and review changes before merging them."

    "\n",
    "![Fork button on GitHub](figures/fork.png)\n",

    "I still have to be careful that there is an original repo, which may have some changes that I also want while I'm working on my version. To keep up to date you will want to 1. add a remote which tracks the original repository\n",

    "```\n",
    "git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/your_tool.git\n",
    "```\n",

    "git fetch origin\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "If you find you have a merge conflict, `git` will stop your merge and ask you to resolve them. You can do this by going into the file with the conflict, and looking for the place where there is a conflict. This will be highlighted using the syntax below\n",
