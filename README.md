# JWST ERS GitHub Hack Tools

In these notebooks we're going to look at how to use git and GitHub, and try to answer these questions?

* How do you get and use someone elseâ€™s code?
* How do you submit an issue for a code you care about?
* How do you fork and contribute to a project?
* How do you make your own code repository?
* How do you make your code usable and enticing to other people?

These notebooks are all going to be in Python, but we'll try to be general where we can!
